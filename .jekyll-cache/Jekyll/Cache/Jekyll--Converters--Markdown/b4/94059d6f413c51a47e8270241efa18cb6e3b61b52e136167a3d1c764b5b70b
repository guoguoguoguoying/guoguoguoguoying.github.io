    <p>What kinds of research could people do using the information in Hansard as a resource?
We can understand the process of social development, the economics, polotics, historical development etc. 
For example, I searched things like â€œCOVID-19â€, and I find so many References, statements. I could know the policies from the first beginning till now, the actions government made and what the publicsâ€™ attitude, and how the government appeased people. It not only helps the government to issue policies to appease the people in response to their emotions and reactions, but also helps the historical records. It can be used as a reference if a similar situation occurs afterwards.</p>

    <p>How well does the Hansard website facilitate those kinds of research?
This only shows past 5 yearsâ€™ results, or all years. We couldnâ€™t filter years like â€œfrom 2000 to 2010â€ and â€œfrom 2010 to 2020â€. So it is hard to make a comparison between decades or years. I also donâ€™t know what the house searching used for. 
But the website is clear and is easy to search. The help using the search is really helpful.</p>
